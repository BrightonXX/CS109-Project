# CS109-Project
The project was completed during the 23-24 fall and received a full score of 110. It was developed by a two-person team without using any demo provided by the school. The purpose is for learning and exchange, and it is not intended for direct replication. Hope this could help you!

Please use IDEA to open this project. You should make a new project in IDEA with "Project\\" as its project path. If the game just not work, go check the path. By the way, it is build in java version 1.80_281. If you use higher version of java you might face with imperfection of images and animations (including too fast or slow animations, error placement of pictures...), but it is playable anyway. If you want further discussion, you could email 12312710@mail.sustech.edu.cn .(I do not promise that I will reply)
